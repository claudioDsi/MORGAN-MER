# MORGAN-MER

## Overview
MORGAN-MER is a Python-based project designed for recommending modeling operations from XES models. The system provides functionalities for training, recommendation, and cross-validation of models using various configurations.

## Features
- **Training Data Preparation**: Process and encode XES models for system training.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Generate recommendations based on the trained knowledge base or session data.
- **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- **Hepsycode Dataset Processing**: Parse and process the hepsycode dataset.

## Installation
To install the project dependencies, run:
```pip install -r requirements.txt ```


## Usage
The main script `main.py` supports different modes of operation:

- **Training Mode**: Prepare data for training

- **Recommendation Mode:** Run the recommender on the knowledge base

- **Session-Based Recommendation Model**: Run the recommender with an increased training set

- **Cross-Validation Mode**: Perform five-fold cross-validation
